# Divide_and_Conquer Branch

## Overview
This branch implements various Divide and Conquer algorithms in the project, including iterative and recursive binary search, as well as a combination of Bubble Sort and Binary Search. The Divide and Conquer approach helps in breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, facilitating efficient problem-solving.

## Introduction
The Divide_and_Conquer branch enhances the project with the implementation of various Divide and Conquer algorithms. These algorithms enable efficient handling of tasks by breaking them down into smaller parts, solving them independently, and then combining their solutions to find the overall solution to the original problem.

## Algorithms Implemented
1. [**Binary Search Iterative**](https://github.com/onurcangnc/Algorithms/blob/Divide_and_Conquer/binarySearchIterative.py): Searches for a target value within a sorted array using an iterative approach.
2. [**Binary Search Recursive**](https://github.com/onurcangnc/Algorithms/blob/Divide_and_Conquer/binarySearchRecursive.py) Searches for a target value within a sorted array using a recursive approach.
3. [**Bubble Sort + Binary Search**](https://github.com/onurcangnc/Algorithms/blob/Divide_and_Conquer/BubbleSort%2BBinarySearch.py): Sorts an array using Bubble Sort and then performs Binary Search on the sorted array.
