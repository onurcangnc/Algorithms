## Algorithms

### Frequency Count
The `frequencyCount` algorithm calculates the frequency of elements in a given list or array. 
- [Frequency Count Branch](../../tree/frequencyCount)

### Frequency Count Arrays
`frequencyCountArrays` extends the frequency counting concept to arrays, providing a comprehensive analysis of element occurrences.
- [Frequency Count Arrays Branch](../../tree/frequencyCountArrays)

### Swap
The `Swap` algorithm swaps the values of two variables, typically used in sorting algorithms and various other scenarios.
- [Swap Branch](../../tree/swap)

### Multiplication Matrices
`MultiplicationMatrices` provides efficient methods for multiplying matrices, a fundamental operation in linear algebra and various computational tasks.
- [Multiplication Matrices Branch](../../tree/multiplicationMatrices)
