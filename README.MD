## Algorithms 🔍

### Frequency Count 🔢
The `frequencyCount` algorithm calculates the frequency of elements in a given list or array. 
- [Frequency Count Branch](../../tree/FrequencyCount)

### Frequency Count Arrays 📊
`frequencyCountArrays` extends the frequency counting concept to arrays, providing a comprehensive analysis of element occurrences.
- [Frequency Count Arrays Branch](../../tree/FrequencyCountArrays)

### Swap ↔️
The `Swap` algorithm swaps the values of two variables, typically used in sorting algorithms and various other scenarios.
- [Swap Branch](../../tree/Swap)

### Multiplication Matrices ✖️
`MultiplicationMatrices` provides efficient methods for multiplying matrices, a fundamental operation in linear algebra and various computational tasks.
- [Multiplication Matrices Branch](../../tree/MultiplicationMatrices)

### Divide and Conquer 🛡️
Divide and Conquer algorithms break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and then combine their solutions to solve the original problem efficiently.
- [Divide and Conquer Branch](../../tree/DivideAndConquer)

### Sorting 🔄
Sorting algorithms arrange a collection of elements in a specific order, such as numerical or lexicographical order, which facilitates easier searching and accessing of elements.
- [Sorting Branch](../../tree/Sorting)
